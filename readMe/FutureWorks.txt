Future work to do:

- Integrate the eterogeneus synapses from different muscles SOL Iaf --> MG Mn etc
- Devide the Motorneuron in thre different groups S FF FR and maybe change their properties (Force gen, EMG gen)

-Complete model +muscles and ms model
- Model on tapis roullant

Next Paper:
- Parameters tuning
- Modulation early response (low/high freq  -> inhibition)
- Effect of low vs high freq stim on MN (low freq -> high peaks and same freq MNvsEES, high freq -> low peaks, more fr and differetn freq MNvsEES)


// Update 8 march 20015

- learning:
	1) model learning from Ziegler et al 2015
	2) implement all Mn and correct EPSP -> EES is not sufficient
	3) show how learning with the current experimentals setups works (increase EPSP iaf mn)
	4) show that with increased EPSP EES works

	5) Design the optimal experimental setup to boost learning!
	6) Test it 
	7) BOOOOOOOOOOMM

- complete closed loop model
	1) add other muscles
	2) test locomotion over treadmil with given network type (Ia II)
	3) check other networks components Ib, RC, Mechanorecepotors foot!
	4) Make it work..

	5) Parameter search of EES -- optimal parameters...
	6) Effect of drugs
	7) Show that the alternation works only if there is no big difference between the number of Ia f activated wrt flexors/extensor 

- test the behaviour of the Mn with EES at low fre (16/22 Hz) --> vedi paper revisionato da marco

// Add
show that the number of iaf for flexors and extensor should be similar otherwise no alternation
